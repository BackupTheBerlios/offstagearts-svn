Resources stuff needs to be totally rewritten.

Goal: Have one ResSet for OffstageArts, and another associated with Sitecode.  Each one can be upgraded / applied independently.  The sitecode will work off a different sysVersion than the main Resset --- it uses sysVersion as set by the sitecode developer, rather than the OffstageArts release cycle.

That way, the Sitecode ResSet can add its own changes to the database independently of the main ResSet.
