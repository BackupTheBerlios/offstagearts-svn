To launch OffstageArts (Macintosh):
 1. Launch FIREFOX (not Safari)
 1. Go to http://offstagearts.org
 2. Click on "Run OffstageArts."
 3. Click on "Current Release."
 4. If it comes up with a box that says "You have chosen to open...", click on "Do this automatically for files like this from now on" and then "OK."
 5. Wait a while while it loads.  This only happens the FIRST time you run OffstageArts.
 6. Box will say "This application was signed by Robert Fischer, but Java cannot verify the authenticity..."  You get past this by:
   a) Click on "Show Certificate"
   b) Click the checkbox on "Always trust these certificates."
   c) Click the "Trust" button.

You are now running.  But... you need to configure OffstageArts when you run it for the first time:

 1. Click on "Setup" on first screen.
 2. Click on "Add Existing."
 3. Under Name, type: Ballet Theatre
 4. Under Directory, type: /Volumes/shared/Offstage/config
 5. Click "OK"
 6. Click "OK"
 7. Click on "Ballet Theatre"

In the future, OffstageArts can be launched the same way.  However, you can also put it in your dock for easy access:
 1. Launch Applications -> Utilities -> Java -> Java Web Start
 2. Click on the OffstageArts line.
 3. Select Application -> Create Desktop Application from the menu bar.
 4. Press "Save"
 5. Go to Applications folder in Finder.
 6. Drag OffstageArts to your dock.
 7. Quit Java Web Start application.
