<FONT SIZE=+2>Using stunnel With Bilateral Authentication</FONT>
<BR>
<HR>
<P>
<B>BACKGROUND</B>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.stunnel.org/">stunnel</A> provides "drop-in" 
SSL-secured connectivity between two hosts.  It is most often used
to retroactively secure an existing application when encryption and/or
authentication were not part of the original design.
<P>
When neither the client nor the server support SSL encapsulation of
a connection, stunnel can be used on both sides of the connection.
<P>
In its default configuration, stunnel does not perform authentication;
it merely encrypts the channel without verifying the endpoints.
<P>
This document describes how to set up stunnel to use signed certificates 
to perform bilateral authentication.  Under this scheme, both the client
and the server provide sufficient credentials (in the form of SSL
certificates signed by a mutually acceptable authority) to establish
their identity.

<B>STUNNEL SECURITY LIMITATIONS</B>
<P>
stunnel has two significant limitations that affect its ability to perform
bilateral authentication.  The first is that there is no provision for 
encrypted keys.  The second is that stunnel does not perform browser-style
checking of the CN name field against the hostname of the connection.  In
combination, these limitations mean that if someone can access an stunnel
key, they will not need a passphrase to decode it and that they can use that
key from any connected host without regard for its hostname or IP address.
<P>
<I>It is therefore vital to ensure that systems with stunnel keys 
are carefully secured and that the keys are stored with the most restrictive
possible permissions.</I>
<P>
This is not a strictly speaking a limitation of stunnel, but rather a 
difficulty HTTP-over-SSL has traditionally worked around by allowing the 
web server to prompt for a passphrase on startup, and by using browsers 
that compare the common name (CN) of a server's certificate to the hostname.
Perhaps a future version of stunnel will offer an option to enable similar
functionality.

<P>

<LI>Construct an stunnel-client.pem file from the key and certificate as 
follows:
<P>

<TT>-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----</TT><BR>
[encoded key]<BR>
<TT>-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----</TT><BR>
<TT>-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----</TT><BR>

<TT>-----END CERTIFICATE-----</TT><BR>
<P>
There are no extra blank lines or extraneous text needed in this file.
<P>

<LI>Copy the CA certificate (ca.crt) to stunnel-auth.pem.
<P>

<LI>Install both stunnel-client.pem and stunnel-auth.pem on the client in
the appropriate stunnel directory (the one specified by --with-pem-dir 
during configure, where the default stunnel.pem is installed).
<P>

<LI>Repeat steps 1 through 5 for the server (server.key, server.csr, 
server.crt, stunnel-server.pem).  The stunnel-auth.pem file will be the
same for the server.
<P>

</OL>

<B>RUNNING STUNNEL</B>
<P>

For this example, we will use mysql-3.23.X, which includes both client and
server pieces and does not support native SSL connections.

<OL>

<LI>Start mysql on the server machine.
<P>
<TT>
YourPrompt> <FONT COLOR="#008000">nohup mysqld --bind-address=127.0.0.1 
--user=mysql &</FONT><BR>
</TT>
<P>

Binding to the localhost IP address (127.0.0.1) ensures that other systems
cannot gain unencrypted/unauthenticated access to MySQL.
<P>

<LI>Start stunnel on the server machine.
<P>
<TT>
YourPrompt> <FONT COLOR="#008000">stunnel -A 
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">/usr/local/stunnel/</FONT>stunnel-auth.pem -v 2 -p 
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">/usr/local/stunnel/</FONT>stunnel-server.pem -d
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">server.example.com</FONT>:3307 -r localhost:3306</FONT>
</TT>
<P>

<LI>Start stunnel on the client machine.
<P>
<TT>
YourPrompt> <FONT COLOR="#008000">stunnel -A 
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">/usr/local/stunnel/</FONT>stunnel-auth.pem -v 2 -p 
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">/usr/local/stunnel/</FONT>stunnel-client.pem -c -d 
localhost:3306 -r <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">server.example.com</FONT>:3307</FONT>
</TT>
<P>

<LI>Test the mysql client on the client machine.
<P>
<TT>
YourPrompt> <FONT COLOR="#008000">mysql -h 127.0.0.1</FONT><BR>
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.<BR>
Your MySQL connection id is 6615 to server version: 3.23.49<BR>
<BR>
Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.<BR>
<BR>
mysql> <FONT COLOR="#008000">\q</FONT><BR>
Bye<BR>
</TT>
<P>

If problems occur with the mysql connection, check the stunnel log files
or use -f to run stunnel in the foreground on each machine.  It will
provide information about any errors that occur in the certificate exchange
process.
<P>

It is important to remember that from the MySQL server, all connections
will appear to be originating from localhost.  MySQL's internal 
user/host/password tables must be configured appropriately.  Also, the
SSL certificate exchange process can be relatively time consuming compared
to an SQL query.  Therefore, connection pooling becomes more important as
a tool to improve performance when security is implemented in this fashion.

</OL>

<B>INCREASING SECURITY</B>
<P>

It is possible to further increase security by requiring stunnel to compare
the certificate presented by its peer against a stored list of acceptable
certificates.  To take advantage of this feature:

<OL>

<LI>Change the '-v 2' parameter of each stunnel command line to '-v 3'.
<P>

<LI>Add each system's certificate to the stunnel-auth.pem file of each 
system it will connect to.
<P>

</OL>

This is particularly appropriate if the certificate authority being used 
also serves any other purpose that should not imply the ability to access 
the resource being secured.
